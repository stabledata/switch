# Switch

Switch is a declarative component library based on the need for a simple form library which was originally called Radix Declarative Form, and eventually evolved to [React Declarative Components](https://react-declarative-components.vercel.app/). Now, it's just called Switch but the idea is the same:

> Render a set of [form] components using a declarative configuration rather than a ton of JSX and manual wiring, controlled inputs etc.

Until the CSS is split, this library is only suitable for consumption in other stable projects. It will however remain open source.
