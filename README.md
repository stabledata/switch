# Switch

Switch is a declarative component library based on the need for a simple form library which was originally called Radix Declarative Form, and eventually evolved to [React Declarative Components](https://react-declarative-components.vercel.app/). Now, it's just called Switch but the idea is the same:

## Render a set of [form] components using a declarative configuration rather than a ton of JSX and manual wiring, controlled inputs etc.
